        The ability to recognize and categorize objects in our everyday life come very naturally to humans.
        When you walk down the street, you probably can distinguish what the various objects that you encounter
        are. You can find people walking their dogs, various cars driving down the road and airplanes flying
        across the sky. What if we wanted machines to recognize these objects? If we had a lot of images we
        needed to analyze and categorize, we could use machines to automate this task. Let's take a look into
        how image recognition is carried out!

        How are we representing an image?
      </p>
      <p class="textContent">
        Your eyes register colors as a combination of red, green and blue light. All the colors that we can see
        are just a combination of different amounts of red, green and blue light. Computers also display colors
        with these three colors. Every pixel on the screen you are using right now can be represented by just
        three values. For example the color of this fuchsia <span style="color:fuchsia">██</span> has red's
        brightness set to 255, green's brightness set to 0 and blue's brightness set to 255. We would say that
        the RGB values for this color is (255, 0, 255). To display the fuchsia, your computer would then use an 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color" target="_blank">additive process</a> to blend these
        values together. Experiment with the puppy below to see how it works!

        Now, what is a convolution?
      </p>
      <p class="textContent">
        In the context of image processing, convolutions are the process of combining the pixels of an image
        with its local neighbors, weighted by something called a
        "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)" target="_blank">Kernel</a>".
        Experiment with the visual below to see how these convolutions are calculated. The left matrix
        represents a portion of an image and the right matrix represents the values in our kernel.

        The bigger picture
      </p>
      <p class="textContent">
        Kernels can have different values depending on the features we want to extract.
        There are kernels that are designed to sharpen images and even detect edges!
        How does an image look after we run some simple convs? Experiment with the
        visualization below to see how a convolution is calculated. An image is represented
        on the left and the resulting convolved image is on the left.

        Layering convolutions
      </p>
      <p class="textContent">
        Using convolutions, we can construct a "network" of convolutions that feed into each other;
        i.e. convolving an image that's already been convolved once.
        Some of these convolutions give great analysis of the images as-is, why not string multiple together?
        We might be able to detect even more specific features with this method. Experiment with the
        visualization below to see how this could be helpful.

        We would like our computer to guess what it is seeing accurately as possible.
        Go ahead and adjust the slider below and try and help the model correctly predict this dog.
        By adjusting the slider, you are changing the values within the image convolutions.

      <p class="textContent">
        Now we have a network that can correctly identify this dog!
        However, it would be nice to have our network adjust the slider automatically without our help.
        Luckily, there is a technique called "Back-propagation"(link) that works similarly to what you did when adjusting the slider!
        The computer will make some predictions and it will move the slider in the direction that seems to best predict the dog.
