                <h1>Color Channels of an RGB Image</h1>
            </header>
            <p>The majority of images are stored as a grid of pixels where each
                pixel holds info on the amount of the colors red, blue, and green
                to display. This means that and RGB image is actually 3 dimensional
                with the layers made up of the different color values. This is important
                in convolution because it means that instead of having just a single
                kernel for an image there will actually be a kernel for each of those
                color layers.
